# SimpleHTTP

A minimal, educational HTTP server built from scratch using Node.js sockets â€” no frameworks, no shortcuts.

## ðŸš€ What is SimpleHTTP?

**SimpleHTTP** is a lightweight web server implemented entirely with Node.js's low-level `net` module (not `http`). It's designed as a learning project to expose the raw mechanics of HTTP â€” from TCP connections to full routing and middleware support.

Youâ€™ll explore:
- TCP socket handling and raw data parsing
- Manual construction of HTTP requests and responses
- A full middleware system (Express-style)
- Static file serving, JSON APIs, form handling
- Rate limiting, CORS, redirect logic, and more

## ðŸ§  Why Build This?

Most developers use Express, Fastify, or Next.js without ever seeing what an HTTP server **actually** does under the hood.

This project was built to:
- Learn the **fundamentals of HTTP and TCP**
- Develop appreciation for what web frameworks abstract away
- Build a base for deeper backend engineering skills
- Gain experience writing extensible, testable server logic from scratch
